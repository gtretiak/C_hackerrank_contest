# C_hackerrank_contest
Programs solving various algorithmic problems

## **Used Techniques**  
- **Data Structures**: Linked lists, BSTs, hash tables, queues  
- **Algorithms**: Bubble sort, bitwise operations, recursion, string rotation  
- **Math & Logic**: Prime checks, binary conversions, geometric patterns  

## **How to Compile and Run**  
All programs are standard C and can be compiled with `gcc`:  
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output  
./output
```
